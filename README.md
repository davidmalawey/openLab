**About** OpenLab Project is the place where David Malawey & friends are publishing a full-stack set of instructions & tools, down to the full PDF datasheets of selected devices, methods of organization, and pairings of materials to build robotics prototypes at a professional level.  We're taking real-world experience from Toyota Manufacturing, Engineering research at Texas A&M with Texas Instruments, National Instruments, and NASA partnerships into an instruction set for making an effective lab.  On top of all that, David & the SCUTTLE Robotics organization has 8+ years of methodologies to build & distribute open source engineering designs for public use and practical applications.   All of this experience is being refined & condensed to create an online guide to lead you on a path to build anything you want, with reliable methods & clear instructions.  Note from David: By late 2025, I anticipate other parties adding to this repository while presently, I am depositing materials to form a structure that makes future contributions effective and orderly.
