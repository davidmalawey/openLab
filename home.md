Welcome to openLab!
I'm documenting the setup of our SCUTTLE Robotics development lab for others to get ideas & methods to make robotics.

## Processes
The lab supports engineering, prototypig, & maker-grade fabrication.
* woodwork: primarily for building fixtures
* metalwork: several processes for metal fab, without CNC machines
* 3D printing: all my best practices for 3D printing prototypes, even those suited for scaling
* paint & polish: make things the way they should look


## Links
I'll try to include many links for products we have actually purchased to put into use.  It's your job to understand if you can make a better selection for yourself, or if you wish to get a perfect match so that you can follow along a process I've documented in videos, etc.
