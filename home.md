## About openLab
A fully documented, model robotics lab with everything you need to perform real engineering, research and development.

It's a collection of tools, processes, and even CAD designs for building a great robotics lab.  The focus is for hands-on designers & researchers of mechatronics, often giving way to robotics. 

Note from David: I'll document several assets from the setup of our SCUTTLE Robotics development lab for others to get ideas & methods to enhance their labs around the world.

## Processes
The lab supports engineering, prototypig, & maker-grade fabrication.
* woodwork: primarily for building fixtures
* metalwork: several processes for metal fab, without CNC machines
* 3D printing: all my best practices for 3D printing prototypes, even those suited for scaling
* paint & polish: make things the way they should look


## Links
I'll try to include many links for products we have actually purchased to put into use.  It's your job to understand if you can make a better selection for yourself, or if you wish to get a perfect match so that you can follow along a process I've documented in videos, etc.
