Organizing Strategies for OpenLab

**Color Codes**
The color codes give a simple way to mark tools and quickly identify size.  The color code is as follows:
* 0 is black
* 1 is white
* 2 is blue
* 3 is green
* 4 is orange
* 5 is red
* 6 is silver
* 7 is yellow
* 8 is purple (grape)
* 9 is gold

Color code is applied to items like sockets and hex drivers. The final digit determines the color, so the sockets of 12mm and 22mm are both blue.  It's easy to identify the size difference of 10 milimeters larger.
