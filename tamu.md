## Texas A&M
This section is for disclosure of my attempts and hopes to improve educational outcomes directly at my workplace at Texas A&M University.  After a decade of working at TAMU, it is understood many improvements lie outside of my control but instead of giving up, I will share some important information by communicating.  The purpose?  If I face problems that are outside of my control then there is zero chance of solving the problem except by communicating.  I may not control the speed or the span of the audience but I think it's dutiful to make this information available.
