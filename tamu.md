## Texas A&M
This section is for disclosure of my attempts and hopes to improve educational outcomes directly at my workplace at Texas A&M University.  After a decade of working at TAMU, it is understood many improvements lie outside of my control but instead of giving up, I will share some important information by communicating.  The purpose?  If I face problems that are outside of my control then there is zero chance of solving the problem except by communicating.  I may not control the speed or the span of the audience but I think it's dutiful to make this information available.

**memo - Long Term Efforts**
notes my changes in strategies to reach students since my work was discarded over time.  Includes examples of discarded efforts.

**memo - Education Performance**
describes first-hand accounts of our quality degradation in a new bachelors program.

**memo - MXET Fitness**
describes my educational work mishandled and lost, cites a graduating student in debt, includes notion of fraud, waste, abuse.

## Hopes
2025.10.10  I hope to use this web page as a recipe to build a lab at Texas A&M. Yesterday I brought some sample parts into Thompson hall to share with students in the hallway.  My activity precedes a display of parts that parallel the student designs I see each year and provide documentation that helps them improve their designs. One student took an interest but the conversation faded after he asked "do we have a fab shop?"  We don't.  We have no fab shop - we have educational labs for recitation of lab tasks, and we have research labs where individual professors maintain their own equipment for research.  Our department is THE very place on the entire TAMU campus which should have a fab shop -  Engineering Technology is Applied Engineering - the massive tradeoff for not being a pure engineer is so that you can gain hands-on experience and we are failing to offer this.

This is my self-reminder that the OpenLab Project must be the place where I formulate what belongs in our fab shop when we one day convince the University to fund one.  If I can self-fund a shop where I can produce any creation, then surely a university can manage to do this. Earlier this year I communicated to my department head about our need for basic supplies such as rags.  I shared this video which discusses the broader concept of the importance of satisfying fundamental needs for hands-on work.  "If a solution existed for 100 years, then we should have had it for 90 years." It is an embarrasment for me to admit to a student we cannot support prototyping in the most famous university in Texas.
