Labeler: [dymo 550](https://amzn.to/3Zqdt9n)
* why: several people asked which labeler I use.  It's a dymo 550.
* I like it because it is fast, reliable, & dispenses blanks if I want to write my own.
* I dislike it because when they upgraded from the 450 model, they added a wireless tag into spools, excluding other brands refills.
