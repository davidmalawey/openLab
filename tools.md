This page is for tools & supplies used in the lab, which meet expectations & are recommended for other makers.  Treat this page as an index of parts while the Lab Tour shows how the parts are arranged in the lab and integrated into processes.

## Admin
Admin tools are for typical business administration, but we focus extra on 5S & communication.

Labeler: [dymo 550](https://amzn.to/3Zqdt9n)
* why: several people asked which labeler I use.  It's a dymo 550.
* I like it because it is fast, reliable, & dispenses blanks if I want to write my own.
* I dislike it because when they upgraded from the 450 model, they added a wireless tag into spools, excluding other brands refills.

## Software

* NAPS2 - for scanning, and making PDFs. My all-time favorite scanning software.  Free, lightweight, opensource, highly compatible, and simple interface.
 * Get the scanning [software From NAPS2.com](https://www.naps2.com/) for your OS
 * Separately, get drivers for your scanning machine.  [download raw epson drivers here](https://ftp.epson.com/drivers/epson16535.exe) or visit [epson drivers page](https://epson.com/Support/Scanners/WorkForce-Series/Epson-WorkForce-DS-510/s/SPT_B11B209201?review-filter=Windows+10+64-bit)
 * Configure your hardware device inside of NAPS2, and ignore softwares offered by Windows and Epson.  (this is best practice for us)
* Label-Printing
 * For printing with the dymo or similar device, again ignore the softwares offered by Dymo
 * Install only the driver, then print from your selected software.
 * For me, I print directly from MS Excel, using a template I have formatted for the size of my label.
 * CTRL-P executes the print from the Excel file, and the DYMO device is selected in the printers list.

## Heavy-Tools

Tools which should last a lifetime, apply to all projects, base-level lab equipment.  These are useful regardless of what type of work you will do - electronics, wood, metal fab, etc.

## Supplies
Let's differentiate supplies from tools.  Description of supplies is as follows:

*Supplies are*
~ consumable items that pair with tools (ie, rivets for rivet gun)
~ parts attainable in bulk or unbranded while meeting a specific need. (ie silicone caulk)
~ items which support organization, like bin dividers.
~ items that may be considered a tool, but are used in this lab as a consumable (ie paint stirring stick). 
~ items which are inventoried in a quantity that may overflow.  ie, we have a hand-cleaner dispenser at the sink, but the bulk cleaner is stored elsewhere.

### Tape
My favorite tapes, in one video. Dated 2024.09. The applications are for nearly every project that takes place.

## Safety

A mix of tools and supplies for safety, PPE, and first aid.  Note safety glasses are color coded so when one pair is assigned to a station, it becomes the color allocated to belong there.  

| Item                | Link |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| DIN CUTTER          | [amazon din cutter](https://amzn.to/437Bm7Z) |
| Headphones          | [runolim headphones $20](https://amzn.to/3RFOOJ2) |
| alcohol wipes       | [alcohol wipes $6](https://amzn.to/3RFOOJ2) |
| safety glasses | [colored safety glasses $14](https://amzn.to/42pCrWB) |

These particular safety glasses are recommended for their color-coding.  They come in a pack of around 12 with 6 colors.  So, we designate a slot at each workstation (soldering, cutting, grinding) where the glasses ought to be used.  Then we mark the slot with the same marking, so they return to their space.  For hanging situations, there's a simple trick with a paperclip and an M2.5 fastener.  (will post a short video to include).

The noise cancelling headphones are more fantastic than expected.  When running a vacuum or high-powered tool, these inexpensive headphones do a marvelous job of cancelling steady, high pitched noise.  At only $20, they compete with regular passive headphones but the comfort is far higher.  For ordinary protective headsets, the padding is more firm and the spring-force is much higher, to create a seal against the head.  But these units have just a gentle squeeze and are so much more enjoyable to wear.  Sometimes I forget to take them off.

## Bins

See [Divider Bin on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/divider-bin-1) to jump straight to my CAD models, true to the measured dimensions. These designs are intended for design of mating parts such as bin racks, and covers.  The upload includes more photos and design notes.

The bins deserve a dedicated section since these are part of several projects, and multiple labs.  Each bin is usually $15 each or higher, but they're industrial and intended to last forever.  Options are available at many reputable distributors for the following options:
* transparent top covers that are load-bearing
* interlocking dividers in gray and black
* Electrostatic dissipating variants, with grounding connector

Here are three different suppliers that have near-matching bin dimensions.  They are compatible enough to stack on one another, but you may measure more closely in order to design your own covers and dividers.  We have ordered and validated the ones from Grainger and Uline.  They're also offered at McMaster (we have not compared this option) and the Lewisbins brand is listed here because the company was kind enough to publish accurate CAD models that we can work with.

**[Distributors]**
* [Akro-Mils at Grainger](https://www.grainger.com/product/AKRO-MILS-Divider-Box-2RV37)
* [Uline brand at Uline distributor](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-16976GR/Plastic-Bins/Divider-Box-15-x-9-x-6-Gray)

### BinRack

We made a special rack for robotic machines to interact with these bins! You can access this rack design for carrying 21 bins, publicly available from Vention.io.  This rack was a design collaboration with Vention designers and David Malawey for our Cobotics Lab at Texas A&M University.  Vention's innovative online system allows for publishing of full design details (if selected as public).  Below are a couple of snapshots of this design.  

[See design at vention.io](https://vention.io/designs/shelving-tamu-165697) to view the design in 3D, bill of materials, and more info.

Why did we want a custom rack?  It is the simplest configuration for loading and unloading with A) a robotic arm with limited degrees of freedom B) a mobile robot with a simple forklift-style actuator, and for computer-vision systems to view all bins entering and exiting for purposes of inventory tracking or supplies management.

## Solder_Station
_last updated 2025.05_
Tools found in the soldering station are tabulated below.  This selection is recommended since the tools were good value and have worked for two years or more.   Some devices are not obvious, such as my custom helping hands made from the camera clamp and the 123 block. The clamp can be removed at any time from the 123 block and used separately.  The adjustable LED camera light also mounts on any 1/4-20 thread which is found in camera tripods and devices for microphone, lighting, and accessories for filming.

## Amazon-Lists
Here are links to lists I wrote up for my amazon associates page.  As of 2025 Feb, the above links are mostly for my associates link (please use these links if you buy the product, this generates revenue for the lab.)  Currently this webpage is more primary source than my amazon account but I may update the amazon lists later this year.

* Tapes, as a category:

## Computing

I'm beginning a section as of 2025.05 to post info about the PC workstation for CAD modeling and other compute-intensive tasks.  
* Access the [Workstation Build Documentation](https://github.com/davidmalawey/openLab/blob/d839ea37850840eac63a235f3625c2dce64fc0c0/docs/2025_PC-Build.pdf)
* Visit [PCpartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/3Jy6Fg) - a great place to document our community builds & assist each other in upgrades.
  * the build linked above is partly outdated, but good to access thumbnails & specs for the parts

The above images of the PC build at different stages.  One big lesson was the removal of the big fancy RTX2060, a high performance video card for graphics, in favor of the AMD Radeon WX4100 card, a purpose-built GPU for professional CAD design.  This selection reduces cost, reduces power consumption, and improves performance by large margins for CAD modeling.  One image depicts the PC case with an included small monitor (I tried it out for a few months) which is sold as a photography display, and can easily source power from the 12v bus on the PC power supply.  For some time this monitor was used to display PC performacne metrics or CAD rendering status.  In the long term it was not necessary.  See also a simple neat deskspace for designing 3D models in our prototyping workflow.
