Tools for 5S & communication

Labeler: [dymo 550](https://amzn.to/3Zqdt9n)
* why: several people asked which labeler I use.  It's a dymo 550.
* I like it because it is fast, reliable, & dispenses blanks if I want to write my own.
* I dislike it because when they upgraded from the 450 model, they added a wireless tag into spools, excluding other brands refills.

## Supplies
Let's differentiate supplies from tools.  Description of supplies is as follows:

*Supplies are*
~ consumable items that pair with tools (ie, rivets for rivet gun)
~ parts attainable in bulk or unbranded while meeting a specific need. (ie silicone caulk)
~ items which support organization, like bin dividers.
~ items that may be considered a tool, but are used in this lab as a consumable (ie paint stirring stick). 
~ items which are inventoried in a quantity that may overflow.  ie, we have a hand-cleaner dispenser at the sink, but the bulk cleaner is stored elsewhere.
