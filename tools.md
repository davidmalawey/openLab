Labeler: [dymo 550](https://amzn.to/3Zqdt9n)
* why: several people asked which labeler I use.  It's a dymo 550.
* I like it because it is fast, reliable, & dispenses blanks if I want to write my own.
* I dislike it because when they upgraded from the 450 model, they added a wireless tag into spools, excluding other brands refills.

## Supplies
Let's differentiate supplies from tools.  Description of supplies is as follows:

*Supplies are*
~ consumable items that pair with tools (ie, rivets for rivet gun)
~ parts attainable in bulk or unbranded while meeting a specific need. (ie silicone caulk)
~ items which support organization, like bin dividers.
~ items that may be considered a tool, but are used in this lab as a consumable (ie paint stirring stick). 
~ items which are inventoried in a quantity that may overflow.  ie, we have a hand-cleaner dispenser at the sink, but the bulk cleaner is stored elsewhere.

## Amazon
Here are links to lists I wrote up for my amazon associates page.  As of 2025 Feb, the above links are mostly for my associates link (please use these links if you buy the product, this generates revenue for the lab.)  Currently this webpage is more primary source than my amazon account but I may update the amazon lists later this year.
