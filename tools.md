Tools for 5S & communication

Labeler: [dymo 550](https://amzn.to/3Zqdt9n)
* why: several people asked which labeler I use.  It's a dymo 550.
* I like it because it is fast, reliable, & dispenses blanks if I want to write my own.
* I dislike it because when they upgraded from the 450 model, they added a wireless tag into spools, excluding other brands refills.

## Software

* NAPS2 - for scanning, and making PDFs. My all-time favorite scanning software.  Free, lightweight, opensource, highly compatible, and simple interface.
 * Get the scanning [software From NAPS2.com](https://www.naps2.com/) for your OS
 * Separately, get drivers for your scanning machine.  [download raw epson drivers here](https://ftp.epson.com/drivers/epson16535.exe) or visit [epson drivers page](https://epson.com/Support/Scanners/WorkForce-Series/Epson-WorkForce-DS-510/s/SPT_B11B209201?review-filter=Windows+10+64-bit)
 * Configure your hardware device inside of NAPS2, and ignore softwares offered by Windows and Epson.  (this is best practice for us)
* Label-Printing
 * For printing with the dymo or similar device, again ignore the softwares offered by Dymo
 * Install only the driver, then print from your selected software.
 * For me, I print directly from MS Excel, using a template I have formatted for the size of my label.
 * CTRL-P executes the print from the Excel file, and the DYMO device is selected in the printers list.

## Heavy Tools

Tools which should last a lifetime, apply to all projects, base-level lab equipment.  These are useful regardless of what type of work you will do - electronics, wood, metal fab, etc.

## Supplies
Let's differentiate supplies from tools.  Description of supplies is as follows:

*Supplies are*
~ consumable items that pair with tools (ie, rivets for rivet gun)
~ parts attainable in bulk or unbranded while meeting a specific need. (ie silicone caulk)
~ items which support organization, like bin dividers.
~ items that may be considered a tool, but are used in this lab as a consumable (ie paint stirring stick). 
~ items which are inventoried in a quantity that may overflow.  ie, we have a hand-cleaner dispenser at the sink, but the bulk cleaner is stored elsewhere.

### Tape
My favorite tapes, in one video. Dated 2024.09. The applications are for nearly every project that takes place.

## Safety

A mix of tools and supplies for safety, PPE, and first aid.  Note safety glasses are color coded so when one pair is assigned to a station, it becomes the color allocated to belong there.

## Amazon
Here are links to lists I wrote up for my amazon associates page.  As of 2025 Feb, the above links are mostly for my associates link (please use these links if you buy the product, this generates revenue for the lab.)  Currently this webpage is more primary source than my amazon account but I may update the amazon lists later this year.

* Tapes, as a category:
