# 3D Printing

## Practical Applications
These slides come from my presentation to an international gathering in Saint Etienne, France in 2019.  The university (ENISE) hosted a 3D printing "summer school" with several speakers and I presented on practical applications for additive manufacturing.
The knowledge up to this point came from about 4 years in FDM printing and 2 years in Metal printing.  My role at Texas A&M included support for undergraduate projects in functional mechatronics devices, and graduate researchers projects in metal sintering, ablating, and melting.

* 56 slides
* methods for design geometry
* postprocessing
* materials selections
* failure modes for metal printing
* brainstorm for viable parts in metal

# Automation
Methods of automation come from industrial side and embedded side.  Embedded automation consists of familiar projects like Arduino circuits.  Industrial automation consists of machines with higher power, more often fixed in place, and usually with wired communication.  These are rarely found together as of 2020, and we want to change that. 

## Mixed Automation
This topic deserves a great deal of documentation, but let's start with existing content from 2021.  The video below demonstrates a combination of embedded and industrial automation systems.  As I document further in the OpenLab, it will look more like the video over time.  You should see the piecewise elements (relays, IoT devices, etc) explained until this video is easy to understand from the ground up.
