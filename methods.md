# 3D Printing

## Practical Applications
These slides come from my presentation to an international gathering in Saint Etienne, France in 2019.  The university (ENISE) hosted a 3D printing "summer school" with several speakers and I presented on practical applications for additive manufacturing.
The knowledge up to this point came from about 4 years in FDM printing and 2 years in Metal printing.  My role at Texas A&M included support for undergraduate projects in functional mechatronics devices, and graduate researchers projects in metal sintering, ablating, and melting.
