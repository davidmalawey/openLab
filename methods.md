> Methods, for engineering, fabricating, and building.  Engineering consists of design, evaluation, benchmarking, parts-research, and documentation. Fabricating consists of constructing parts from raw materials, and building refers to all technician-level activities.  Methods offer standard instructions that can be applied to multiple different actions, in the overall engineering process.

## Published
Publications, or published methods: These are whole collections of methods combined into subject-focused reports.  Here I will attach various documents such as workshop slides, instruction sets, or topic research data.  As of Feb 2025, I would like to post all of the relevant information directly in this repository, but this may take years.  To speed up the process, I will upload several publications that I used in the past decade which carry clusters of key info.

### Additive Mfg
**Additive Manufacturing** or AM for short. These slides come from my presentation to an international gathering in Saint Etienne, France in 2019.  The university (ENISE) hosted a 3D printing "summer school" with several speakers and I presented on practical applications for additive manufacturing.
The knowledge up to this point came from about 4 years in FDM printing and 2 years in Metal printing.  My role at Texas A&M included support for undergraduate projects in functional mechatronics devices, and graduate researchers projects in metal sintering, ablating, and melting.

[Slides - AM Practical Applications, 2019](https://github.com/davidmalawey/openLab/blob/c622927094335e10a5a4ff06f1d90047ed1be2ec/docs/2019_AdditiveManufacturingSlides.pdf)
* 56 slides
* methods for design geometry
* postprocessing
* materials selections
* failure modes for metal printing
* brainstorm for viable parts in metal

### Automation
Methods of automation come from industrial side and embedded side.  Embedded automation consists of familiar projects like Arduino circuits.  Industrial automation consists of machines with higher power, more often fixed in place, and usually with wired communication.  These are rarely found together as of 2020, and we want to change that. 

## Industry_4.0
Blended automation or Industry 4.0 are appropriate terms for this category.  For Blended automation we will blend the simple off-the-shelf circuits with the traditional industrial systems for automation, like in Manufacturing plants. This topic deserves a great deal of documentation, but let's start with existing content from 2021.  The video below demonstrates a combination of embedded and industrial automation systems.  As I document further in the OpenLab, it will look more like the video over time.  You should see the piecewise elements (relays, IoT devices, etc) explained until this video is easy to understand from the ground up.

In this section, starting 2025 I can begin to write key methods directly into the openLab webpage.  -David M
