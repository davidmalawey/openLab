## Printegrate:
Integrating 3d printing with off-the-shelf parts. This page is for examples that integrate 3D printing with OTS parts.  I'll call it printegrating, to set apart these designs from all the world's 3D printed parts.

**Reducer**
An example part for reducing a hole to host a fastener.  One example is to outfit concentric shafts in a steel outlet box to achieve nicely-aligned axes in a gearbox.   The second example offers a location for M8 fastener in a large 14mm hole of a disc brake.  Utility aside, it's a lesson in compliant mechanisms, gaining concentricity, bearing loads on a 3D printed part, retaining a steel nut with friction.
